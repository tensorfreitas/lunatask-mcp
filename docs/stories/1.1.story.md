# Story 1.1: Project Initialization

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to have a standardized project structure with `uv` for dependency management and a Git repository,
**so that** I can begin development with a clean, organized, and version-controlled foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Project structure follows src layout: `src/lunatask_mcp/` exists and contains `__init__.py`.
2. Project is initialized with `uv`, producing `pyproject.toml` with PEP 621 metadata and `requires-python` set to ">=3.12,<3.13".
3. A `uv`-managed virtual environment is created and recognized (e.g., `uv venv`), and activation instructions are documented.
4. ALL tech stack dependencies are added via `uv` and recorded in `pyproject.toml`; a lockfile (e.g., `uv.lock`) is present. Required dependencies: `fastmcp`, `httpx`, `pydantic`, `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `ruff`, `pyright`, `pre-commit`.
5. A Git repository is initialized on `main`; the initial commit includes `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and the `src/` structure; `git status` is clean.
6. `.gitignore` includes standard Python, virtualenv, `uv`, macOS, and common editor exclusions.
7. `README.md` contains the project title, a one-sentence description, and a Quickstart with `uv` commands and an import check.
8. A top-level `tests/` directory exists (even empty) to align with coding standards.
9. Import check succeeds in the `uv` environment: `python -c "import lunatask_mcp"` exits with code 0.
10. Development toolchain is configured: `ruff` and `pyright` settings in `pyproject.toml` follow coding standards (line length 100, strict type checking).
11. Pre-commit configuration (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) is created with hooks for `ruff` and `pyright`; `pre-commit install` is executed.
12. Toolchain verification succeeds: `ruff check .`, `pyright .`, and `pre-commit run --all-files` execute without errors.

## Dev Notes

### Source Tree
The project will be organized using a standard, installable Python package layout. The source code will reside within a `src` directory. The package itself will be descriptively named `lunatask_mcp`. [Source: docs/architecture/8-source-tree.md]

### Tech Stack
*   **Language:** Python ~3.12
*   **Package/Venv Mgmt:** `uv`
*   **Framework:** `fastmcp`
*   **HTTP Client:** `httpx`
[Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

### Coding Standards
*   Code style will be enforced by `ruff`.
*   Type checking will be enforced by `pyright`.
*   Tests will be located in the top-level `tests/` directory.
*   Docstrings must follow the Google Python Style Guide format.
[Source: docs/architecture/11-coding-standards.md]

### Testing
*   Test-Driven Development (TDD) is the required methodology.
*   Tests will be located in the top-level `tests/` directory.
*   Test filenames must follow the `test_*.py` pattern.

## QA Results

### Review Date: August 12, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of the project initialization requirements. The developer has successfully created a well-structured Python project following modern best practices with `uv` dependency management, comprehensive toolchain setup, and proper project structure. The implementation demonstrates good understanding of Python packaging standards and development workflows.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/lunatask_mcp/__init__.py
  - **Change**: Added missing `main()` function and proper logging setup
  - **Why**: The pyproject.toml defined a script entry point `lunatask-mcp = "lunatask_mcp:main"` but no main function existed, which would cause runtime errors
  - **How**: Implemented proper main function with logging configuration following Python best practices, avoiding print statements that violate coding standards

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All ruff and pyright checks pass, proper line length (100), strict type checking enabled
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows src layout with `src/lunatask_mcp/` structure as specified in Dev Notes
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Top-level `tests/` directory created, testing framework (pytest) installed
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 12 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Added missing main() function for script entry point (src/lunatask_mcp/__init__.py)
- [x] Implemented proper logging instead of print statements to meet coding standards
- [x] Verified all toolchain configurations work correctly
- [x] Confirmed import verification passes
- [x] Validated pre-commit hooks function properly

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The project follows Python security best practices:
- Dependencies are properly locked in uv.lock
- .gitignore appropriately excludes sensitive files (.env, credentials, etc.)
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials present

### Performance Considerations

No performance issues identified at this initialization stage. The project structure supports efficient development:
- Proper src layout enables optimal package imports
- uv provides fast dependency resolution and virtual environment management
- Toolchain configured for development efficiency

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

All acceptance criteria have been met, the codebase follows established standards, and the project is properly initialized for development. The implementation demonstrates thorough attention to detail and adherence to modern Python development practices.
