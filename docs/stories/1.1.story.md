# Story 1.1: Project Initialization

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to have a standardized project structure with `uv` for dependency management and a Git repository,
**so that** I can begin development with a clean, organized, and version-controlled foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Project structure follows src layout: `src/lunatask_mcp/` exists and contains `__init__.py`.
2. Project is initialized with `uv`, producing `pyproject.toml` with PEP 621 metadata and `requires-python` set to ">=3.12,<3.13".
3. A `uv`-managed virtual environment is created and recognized (e.g., `uv venv`), and activation instructions are documented.
4. Dependencies `fastmcp` and `httpx` are added via `uv` and recorded in `pyproject.toml`; a lockfile (e.g., `uv.lock`) is present.
5. A Git repository is initialized on `main`; the initial commit includes `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and the `src/` structure; `git status` is clean.
6. `.gitignore` includes standard Python, virtualenv, `uv`, macOS, and common editor exclusions.
7. `README.md` contains the project title, a one-sentence description, and a Quickstart with `uv` commands and an import check.
8. A top-level `tests/` directory exists (even empty) to align with coding standards.
9. Import check succeeds in the `uv` environment: `python -c "import lunatask_mcp"` exits with code 0.

- [ ] Task 2: Initialize `uv` project (AC: 2, 3)
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Run `uv init` to create `pyproject.toml`
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Set `requires-python` to ">=3.12,<3.13" in `pyproject.toml`
    - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Create a `uv`-managed virtual environment (e.g., `uv venv`)
- [ ] Task 3: Add dependencies (AC: 4)
    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Run `uv add fastmcp httpx`
    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Verify lockfile creation and dependency entries in `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Task 4: Initialize Git repository (AC: 5)
    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Run `git init` with `main` as default branch
    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Make initial commit including `src/`, `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`
- [ ] Task 5: Create `.gitignore` file (AC: 6)
    - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Include Python, venv, `uv`, OS, and editor exclusions

    - [ ] Subtask 6.1: Add title and one-line description
    - [ ] Subtask 6.2: Add Quickstart with `uv` commands and an import verification step
- [ ] Task 7: Import verification (AC: 9)
    - [ ] Subtask 7.1: Run `python -c "import lunatask_mcp"` in the `uv` environment

## Dev Notes

### Source Tree
The project will be organized using a standard, installable Python package layout. The source code will reside within a `src` directory. The package itself will be descriptively named `lunatask_mcp`. [Source: docs/architecture/8-source-tree.md]

### Tech Stack
*   **Language:** Python ~3.12
*   **Package/Venv Mgmt:** `uv`
*   **Framework:** `fastmcp`
*   **HTTP Client:** `httpx`
[Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

### Coding Standards
*   Code style will be enforced by `ruff`.
*   Type checking will be enforced by `pyright`.
*   Tests will be located in the top-level `tests/` directory.
*   Docstrings must follow the Google Python Style Guide format.

### Testing
*   Test-Driven Development (TDD) is the required methodology.
*   Tests will be located in the top-level `tests/` directory.
*   Test filenames must follow the `test_*.py` pattern.
