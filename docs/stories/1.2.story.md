# Story 1.2: Basic Stdio Server

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement a minimal, runnable FastMCP server that communicates over `stdio`,
**so that** I can verify the core transport layer is working correctly with a client.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A main application file (e.g., `server.py`) is created.
2. The file contains a basic FastMCP server instance.
3. The server, when run, listens for requests on `stdio` by default.
4. The server includes a simple "ping" or "health-check" tool that returns a static response (e.g., "pong").
5. A client script can successfully call the "ping" tool and receive the "pong" response via `stdio`.
6. The server directs all logging output to `stderr` to avoid interfering with the `stdio` JSON-RPC channel.
7. The console script entry point in `pyproject.toml` maps to `lunatask_mcp.main:main`, and running the CLI starts the stdio server without emitting non-protocol stdout.
8. The server exposes MCP metadata (name, version) and declares capabilities including the ping tool during initialize.
9. Stdout purity: no output other than MCP JSON-RPC frames; all logs are on stderr with timestamp and level.
10. A client test/script uses the Python SDK client over stdio to invoke the ping tool and receives "pong".
11. Graceful shutdown: cancellation and unhandled exceptions are logged to stderr without corrupting stdout protocol framing.
12. Static quality: all new functions have explicit type hints and Google-style docstrings and pass ruff checks.
13. Dependencies are pinned to SDK versions compatible with the targeted MCP spec version.
14. Protocol version negotiation targets MCP version `2025-06-18` and succeeds during initialize.
15. The ping tool accepts the execution context object and uses its scoped logger (no print statements).
16. Server properly handles request cancellation and propagates context cancellation to tool implementations.
17. All server responses comply with JSON-RPC 2.0 specification including proper id correlation and error format.
18. Client test verifies server capabilities before invoking tools and handles capability mismatches gracefully.
