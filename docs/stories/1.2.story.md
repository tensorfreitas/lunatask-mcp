# Story 1.2: Basic Stdio Server

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement a minimal, runnable FastMCP server that communicates over `stdio`,
**so that** I can verify the core transport layer is working correctly with a client.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A main application file (e.g., `server.py`) is created.
2. The file contains a basic FastMCP server instance.
3. The server, when run, listens for requests on `stdio` by default.
4. The server includes a simple "ping" or "health-check" tool that returns a static response (e.g., "pong").
5. A client script can successfully call the "ping" tool and receive the "pong" response via `stdio`.
6. The server directs all logging output to `stderr` to avoid interfering with the `stdio` JSON-RPC channel.
7. The console script entry point in `pyproject.toml` maps to `lunatask_mcp.main:main`, and running the CLI starts the stdio server without emitting non-protocol stdout.
8. The server exposes MCP metadata (name, version) and declares capabilities including the ping tool during initialize.
9. Stdout purity: no output other than MCP JSON-RPC frames; all logs are on stderr with timestamp and level.
10. A client test/script uses the Python SDK client over stdio to invoke the ping tool and receives "pong".
11. Graceful shutdown: cancellation and unhandled exceptions are logged to stderr without corrupting stdout protocol framing.
12. Static quality: all new functions have explicit type hints and Google-style docstrings and pass ruff checks.
13. Dependencies are pinned to SDK versions compatible with the targeted MCP spec version.
14. Protocol version negotiation targets MCP version `2025-06-18` and succeeds during initialize.
15. The ping tool accepts the execution context object and uses its scoped logger (no print statements).
16. Server properly handles request cancellation and propagates context cancellation to tool implementations.
17. All server responses comply with JSON-RPC 2.0 specification including proper id correlation and error format.
18. Client test verifies server capabilities before invoking tools and handles capability mismatches gracefully.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Project structure already established with `src/lunatask_mcp/` layout [Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]
- Virtual environment and all tech stack dependencies already installed: fastmcp, httpx, pydantic, pytest, pytest-asyncio [Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]
- Main entry point currently exists in `src/lunatask_mcp/__init__.py` but should be moved to `main.py` per architecture [Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]

### Source Tree
- Main application entry point should be `src/lunatask_mcp/main.py` containing the CoreServer class [Source: architecture/8-source-tree.md]
- Current entry point in `__init__.py` needs to be aligned with architecture specification
- Entry point script configured in `pyproject.toml` as `lunatask-mcp = "lunatask_mcp.main:main"`

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: `fastmcp` latest - Core MCP server framework, official SDK implementation [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Python ~3.12 - Project requirement for optimal performance [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Testing**: `pytest` latest with `pytest-asyncio` plugin for async testing [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

### Architecture Patterns
- **Asynchronous I/O**: Foundational pattern for handling stdio streams without blocking [Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Decorator-Based Configuration**: Use tool decorators to define server capabilities [Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Single, event-driven monolith**: Core architectural style for this local utility [Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]

### Component Specifications
- **CoreServer (Application Runner)**: Main entry point responsible for initializing FastMCP, handling configuration, setting up logging to stderr, and starting server with stdio transport [Source: architecture/5-components.md]
- Server must handle MCP protocol version negotiation (`2025-06-18`) [Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]

### File Locations
- Main server file: `src/lunatask_mcp/main.py` [Source: architecture/8-source-tree.md]
- Test files: `tests/test_*.py` [Source: architecture/8-source-tree.md]
- Tests must be in top-level `tests/` directory [Source: architecture/11-coding-standards.md]

### Logging Standards
- **Output Channel**: All logging MUST be directed to `sys.stderr` to prevent corrupting stdout JSON-RPC channel [Source: architecture/10-error-handling-strategy.md]
- **Format**: Logs will include timestamp, log level, and message [Source: architecture/10-error-handling-strategy.md]
- **Context logger**: Tool implementations use the execution context’s scoped logger [Source: server-concepts]
- **No print() statements**: print() is forbidden, use configured logger [Source: architecture/11-coding-standards.md]

### Testing Requirements
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is required methodology [Source: architecture/11-coding-standards.md]
- Tests located in top-level `tests/` directory with `test_*.py` pattern [Source: architecture/11-coding-standards.md]
- All new code must use async/await and include type hints [Source: architecture/11-coding-standards.md]
- Tests must use pytest with pytest-asyncio for async functionality [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- Client tests use the Python SDK client configured for stdio transport [Source: client-concepts]
- Specific testing requirements: Unit tests for ping tool, integration test for stdio server startup and initialize negotiation [Source: Story requirements analysis]

### Technical Constraints
- **Python 3.12** compatibility required [Source: architecture/11-coding-standards.md]
- **Line length**: Maximum 100 characters enforced by ruff [Source: architecture/11-coding-standards.md]
- **Type hints**: All function signatures must have explicit type hints [Source: architecture/11-coding-standards.md]
- **Docstrings**: Google Python Style Guide format required [Source: architecture/11-coding-standards.md]
- **MCP Spec Target**: `2025-06-18`; dependencies pinned to compatible versions [Source: specification/versioning]

### Testing
- Test file location: `tests/` directory [Source: architecture/11-coding-standards.md]
- Test standards: TDD methodology required - write tests first, watch fail, implement minimal code, refactor [Source: architecture/11-coding-standards.md]
- Testing frameworks: `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio` plugin for async testing [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- Specific testing requirements: Unit tests for ping tool, integration test for stdio server startup and stdout/stderr verification [Source: Story requirements analysis]

### MCP Protocol Compliance
- **Request Cancellation**: Server must handle request cancellation properly using AsyncIO task cancellation [Source: server-concepts]
- **JSON-RPC 2.0**: All messages must comply with JSON-RPC 2.0 specification including proper id correlation [Source: architecture]
- **Capability Discovery**: Clients should verify server capabilities before invoking tools [Source: client-concepts]
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses per MCP specification [Source: server-concepts]

### Protocol Message Examples
Expected JSON-RPC message formats:

**Initialize Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
    "capabilities": {},
    "clientInfo": {"name": "test-client", "version": "1.0.0"}
  }
}
```

**Initialize Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
    "capabilities": {"tools": {}},
    "serverInfo": {"name": "lunatask-mcp", "version": "0.1.0"}
  }
}
```

**Tool Call Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "ping",
    "arguments": {}
  }
}
```

**Tool Call Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "pong"}]
  }
}
```

### Capability Declarations
- **Tools**: Server declares `tools` capability with ping tool
- **Resources**: Intentionally not implemented - server declares no resource capabilities
- **Prompts**: Intentionally not implemented - server declares no prompt capabilities
- **Notifications**: Server supports standard MCP notifications for logging/progress
